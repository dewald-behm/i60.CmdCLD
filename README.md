# CmdCLD

A desktop terminal manager for running multiple [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and Codex CLI sessions simultaneously. Built with Electron, React, and xterm.js.

Open multiple project folders, each running its own Claude or Codex CLI instance in a resizable grid or focused full-screen view. Switch between projects instantly, spawn plain shells, paste screenshots directly into conversations, and manage everything from a compact sidebar.

## Features

**Multi-Terminal Grid**
- Open multiple Claude or Codex CLI sessions side-by-side in an auto-arranging grid
- Switch to focused mode (one terminal full-screen) via the sidebar
- Drag to rearrange, resize panels freely
- Smart layout: 2 terminals = full-height columns, 4 = 2x2 grid, etc.

**Sidebar Navigation**
- Collapsible sidebar with folder list, recent folders (SQLite-backed), and quick actions
- Click a folder to focus it, "Show All" to return to grid
- Busy/idle indicators: dots pulse when an agent is working

**Terminal Features**
- Ctrl+V paste with clipboard image support (screenshots saved to `.screenshots/` in your project)
- Ctrl+F search through terminal scrollback
- Ctrl+=/- font zoom (Ctrl+0 to reset)
- Clickable URLs (open in browser) and file paths (open in editor)
- Clickable `.md` files open in a built-in rendered markdown viewer
- VS Code Dark+ color theme

**Quick Actions (Terminal Header)**
- `>_` Open a plain shell for the same folder (for npm, git, builds)
- Pencil icon: Open folder in your configured editor
- Folder icon: Open in file explorer
- Right-click to switch between installed editors

**Remote Access**
- Access your Claude or Codex sessions from any device on your network (phone, tablet, another PC)
- Enable from Settings — starts an Express + Socket.IO server on a configurable port
- Dashboard shows all active sessions with busy/idle status
- Create new sessions from favorite or recent folders remotely
- Full terminal on desktop browsers, read-only output + quick buttons on mobile
- Paste or upload images from remote devices
- Auto-discovers local network IPs and Tailscale addresses
- Includes a setup guide for Tailscale-based access from anywhere

**Settings**
- Configurable Claude and Codex CLI launch arguments with provider-specific quick presets
- Default agent CLI selector with installed CLI availability detection
- "Ask before launch" mode: edit flags each time you open a folder
- Default view mode: grid or focused
- Notification sound when terminal finishes work (toggle on/off)
- Auto-detect installed editors (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Projects root for one-click new project creation
- App version displayed in settings dialog

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+1-9 | Switch to terminal by index |
| Ctrl+T | Add folder |
| Ctrl+` | Show all (grid view) |
| Ctrl+F | Search in terminal |
| Ctrl+=/- | Zoom in/out |
| Ctrl+0 | Reset zoom |
| Ctrl+End | Scroll terminal to bottom (no input sent) |

**Other**
- Always starts with a blank slate (no session restore)
- Close All button to kill all terminals at once
- Single instance lock (second launch focuses existing window)
- Multi-window support (new windows start empty)
- Recent folders remembered across sessions (last 20)
- PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) used when available, falls back to Windows PowerShell
- Cross-platform shell detection (bash/zsh on Mac/Linux)
- Window bounds saved and restored

## Download

Prebuilt installers for every release are attached to the
[latest release](https://github.com/LeonNel123/i60.CmdCLD/releases/latest) — no toolchain
or build step required.

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `CmdCLD-Setup-<version>.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `CmdCLD-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `CmdCLD-<version>-x64.dmg` |

### First launch

The builds are **not code-signed**, so both operating systems warn on first run. The
binaries are built in public by [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/release.yml) from the
tagged commit, so you can check the build log for any release.

**Windows** — SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"*. Click **More info**, then
**Run anyway**.

**macOS** — Gatekeeper usually reports the app as *"damaged and can't be opened"*. It is
not damaged; that is the message for an unsigned app carrying the download quarantine
flag. Clear it once after dragging to Applications:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/CmdCLD.app
```

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonNel123/i60.CmdCLD.git
cd i60.CmdCLD
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Installer

```bash
npm run package:win      # Windows (NSIS installer)
npm run package:mac      # macOS (DMG)
npm run package:linux    # Linux (AppImage)
```

### Cut a Release

```bash
npm run release:tag      # bump patch version, commit, tag, push
```

Pushing the tag runs the release workflow, which builds Windows and macOS installers on
their native runners and attaches them to the GitHub Release. Nothing needs to be built
by hand on a Mac.

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Tech Stack

- **Electron** — desktop app framework
- **React 18** — UI
- **xterm.js** — terminal emulation (with search, web-links, fit addons)
- **node-pty** — pseudo-terminal for shell processes
- **react-grid-layout** — draggable/resizable grid
- **sql.js** — SQLite for recent folders (pure JS, no native build needed)
- **marked** — markdown rendering
- **Express** — remote access HTTP server
- **Socket.IO** — real-time terminal streaming for remote clients
- **electron-builder** — packaging and installer
